# Your questions

While interviewing to a new position, you're shouldn't be the only one who is answering questions.
Instead you should be prepared to ask your own.

And your questions can (and should) be technical too,
since you want to be sure that their level of expertise meet your expectations.

* About their tech.
* The reasoning behind it?
* Why last engineer quit?
* Which tech they want to use next?
* What is your git workflow?
